//! Self-healing pass that reconciles documents whose LLM graph extraction
//! finished but whose `reconcile_revision_graph` never produced a document
//! node in the projection.
//!
//! Root cause this module addresses: the `extract_graph` stage can succeed
//! at the per-chunk level (`runtime_graph_extraction` rows flipped to
//! `ready`) yet still fail at the stage level — typically via the 600-second
//! canonical wall-clock timeout on a long document, or a projection write
//! failure. When the stage fails, the worker skips the downstream
//! `reconcile_revision_graph` call, so the extracted entities/relations
//! never become `runtime_graph_node` / `runtime_graph_edge` rows. The
//! dashboard keeps showing the document as "readable" while the graph
//! viewer never learns it exists.
//!
//! The backfill pass queries documents in this exact state and replays
//! `reconcile_revision_graph` against the already-persisted extraction
//! records. No LLM call is made — the merge runs purely over the `ready`
//! records in Postgres. Typically cheap (milliseconds per document).
//!
//! # Debounce
//!
//! Library-wide passes cost O(missing-docs × reconcile-cost). Under a full
//! queue burst every finishing job would kick another pass while the
//! previous pass is still walking the same set of documents. A dedicated
//! 60 s slot per library compresses that burst; the slot is independent of
//! the maintenance slot so heavy maintenance work does not starve
//! backfill, and vice versa.
